### How to

- Run Server.java
- Run Game.java (This will connect the first player to the network)
- Run Game.java again (This will connect the second player to the network)

### What it can do right now

- Connect players through a network
- Color the grid when clicking on it
- Handle turns: disable clicking for one player when it's the other's turn


### What's missing
- Game logic
- Menu (done separately, but still not connected to the rest of the code)
